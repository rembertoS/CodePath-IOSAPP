## Video Walkthrough

I cannot do a video because when i install a screen recording software my computer has issues with then letting lockdown browser work and i need it for exams so i cannot do it I previously had an issue with it and even after deleting both ScreenCastify and google chrome itself my lockdown browser still did not work. 


If this is a serious requirement and i wont be able to get into the course without doing a video i could record the app with my phone and email it to you. 

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

    1: Structured: 
    - I like how you can change the entire theme of the app and it changes even the app icon on your phone 
    2: My fitness pal 
    - I like the app's dashboard its simple but it gives the app a clean look and makes it easy to use 
    3: Instagram 
    - I like all of the different themes you can set for specific conversations 
    
- I really like apps that are able to be customized heavily without making it look tacky or cheap 
    
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- i moved the file from my desktop to documents and then it refused to work in x code this was about half way through the project and i had to restart.
